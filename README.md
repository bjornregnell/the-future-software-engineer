# The Future Software Engineer

Talk by Prof. Björn Regnell at Foo Café 12th anniversary, 2024 August 27 

**What every junior software developer must know to stay relevant in the AI-boosted era**

## Intro

The "Death of Programming", was recently predicted by Jensen Huang, the top boss at NVidia that make AI chips that heat up the plannet.

Is he right that AI will take the jobs of human coders? 

I don't think so. We have heard the story before. Already in 1957 the ancient programming language Fortran was introduced in an academic paper entiteled "The FORTRAN Automatic Coding System". And the assembler programmers were complaining. Some cried that the compiler will take their coding work. Others claimed that its better that humans write assembler code as a compiler is not smart enough to do the tricky things.


### About me
I do teaching and research in software engineering. The last 8 years I have been responsible for the introductary programming course for Master students in IT at LTH, Faculty of Engineering at Lund University.
