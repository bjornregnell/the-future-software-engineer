# The Future Software Engineer

Talk by Prof. Björn Regnell at Foo Café 12th anniversary, 2024 August 27 

**What every junior software developer must know to stay relevant in the AI-boosted era**

### About me
I do teaching and research in software engineering. The last 8 years I have been responsible for the introductary programming course for Master students in IT at LTH, Faculty of Engineering at Lund University.

## Intro

The "Death of Programming", was recently predicted by Jensen Huang, the top boss at NVidia that make AI chips that heat up the plannet.

Is he right that AI will take the jobs of human coders? 

We have heard the story before. Already in 1957 the ancient programming language Fortran was introduced in an academic paper entiteled "The FORTRAN Automatic Coding System". And the assembler programmers were complaining. Some cried that the compiler will take their work. Others claimed that it was better that humans write the machine code as the compiler is not smart enough to do the trickiest optimizations and the machine code will be of higher quality if humans write it.

What happened? Thanks to the compiler, software engineers could start coding at a higher abstraction level and get more done. Did assembler programmers loose their jobs? No, but the needed to learn new things. And they had really good use of their deep knowledge in machine coding when writing source code. We still today teach about machine programming as all well-educated software engineers need to understand what is actually happening at different abstraction levels.

The programming languages of the 60'ies provided abstraction mechisms that enabled the construction of much more complex software at a much higher productivity rate. And the story repeats itself on and on in the history of software engineering: powerful abstractions enable us to create more complex software, and when it gets too complex we need to create more powerful abstractions.
